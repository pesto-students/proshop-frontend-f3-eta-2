# Technology Stack
  We tried to use a completely modern tech stack while testing out some new technologies that we had never used before. This resulted in a fast, performant, and         easily-extensible web app that should be fairly future-proof for the coming next several years. We used:

  - React JS
  - Redux
  - HTML
  - CSS
